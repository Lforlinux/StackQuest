## DevOps methodology, practices, & Agile

<details>
<summary>What is meant by continuous integration?</summary>

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, typically several times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by building the project and running automated tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

Key benefits of CI:
- Early detection of integration problems
- Reduced integration time and effort
- Higher code quality
- Faster feedback to developers
- Reduced risk of project delays

<summary>What are the advantages of DevOps?</summary>

DevOps brings several key advantages to software development and operations:

**Faster Delivery:**
- Reduced time to market
- Faster deployment cycles
- Quicker bug fixes and feature releases

**Improved Quality:**
- Automated testing and quality assurance
- Consistent deployment processes
- Reduced human errors

**Better Collaboration:**
- Breaking down silos between development and operations
- Shared responsibility and accountability
- Improved communication and transparency

**Increased Reliability:**
- Automated deployment processes
- Better monitoring and alerting
- Faster recovery from failures

**Cost Efficiency:**
- Reduced manual effort
- Better resource utilization
- Lower operational costs

<summary>Can you describe some branching strategies you have used?</summary>

Common branching strategies include:

**Git Flow:**
- `main` branch for production releases
- `develop` branch for integration
- Feature branches for new features
- Release branches for preparing releases
- Hotfix branches for urgent fixes

**GitHub Flow:**
- `main` branch always deployable
- Feature branches for all changes
- Pull requests for code review
- Merge to main after review and testing

**GitLab Flow:**
- Environment branches (staging, production)
- Feature branches
- Upstream first principle
- Merge requests with approval process

**Trunk-based Development:**
- Single main branch
- Short-lived feature branches
- Frequent integration
- Feature flags for incomplete features

**Best Practices:**
- Keep branches short-lived
- Use descriptive branch names
- Regular integration with main branch
- Automated testing on all branches

<summary>What is the blue/green deployment pattern?</summary>

Blue/Green deployment is a deployment strategy that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green.

**How it works:**
- **Blue Environment**: Currently serving live traffic
- **Green Environment**: Identical environment for new version
- Deploy new version to Green environment
- Test Green environment thoroughly
- Switch traffic from Blue to Green
- Keep Blue as rollback option

**Benefits:**
- Zero downtime deployments
- Instant rollback capability
- Reduced deployment risk
- Easy testing of new versions
- No impact on live users during deployment

**Considerations:**
- Requires double infrastructure resources
- Database migration challenges
- Session state management
- Higher cost due to duplicate environments

**Use Cases:**
- Critical production applications
- High-traffic websites
- Applications requiring zero downtime
- When rollback speed is crucial
